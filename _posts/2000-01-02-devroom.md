## The DevRoom

The Kotlin DevRoom is a co-located **conference-within-a-conference** that gives us the opportunity to come together and chat, hack, and share stories about Kotlin usage in the FLOSS ecosystems.

The DevRoom will take place on **Saturday 4th of February 2023**, at **ULB (Campus Solbosch)** in Brussels, Belgium.

Join us to enjoy a full day of talks, demos, and interesting discussions about Kotlin!

## About FOSDEM

From: [https://fosdem.org/2023/about/](https://fosdem.org/2023/about/)
FOSDEM is a free and non-commercial event organized by the community, for the community.

The goal is to provide free and open source software developers and communities a place to meet to:

- get in touch with other developers and projects
- be informed about the latest developments in the free software and open source world
- attend interesting talks and presentations on various topics by project leaders and committers
- promote the development and benefits of free software and open source solutions

Participation and attendance is totally free, though the organizers gratefully accept donations and sponsorship.
